= Field System Linux Distribution

IMPORTANT: New installations should use the latest available
distribution. FSL10 has been superseded by FSL11,
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fsl11. FSL11 may have also been superseded
by the time you read this. Please check FSL11 or you can look for
later distributions: FSL12, etc.

This archive contains instructions and utilities for setting up a standard Field System Linux system.
While you can will be able to install the Field System on other Linux distributions, the system
is a tried-and-tested setup for robust VLBI operations. 

Using this guide will make it easier to
ask the community for help.

Follow the https://nvi-inc.github.io/fsl10[installation notes] to get started.
