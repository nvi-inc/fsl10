Special instructions for X11SCA-F motherboard

. When beginning put network cable in the second (right) interface.
. At the beginning of the Third Stage Installation:
.. cd /usr/local/src
.. tar xzf /root/fsl10/X11SCA-F/e1000e-3.6.0.tar.gz
.. cd e1000e-3.6.0/src
.. make
.. make install
.. Move the network cable to the first (left) interface.
.. reboot
. Continue with the Third Stage Installation

The driver will need to be re-installed after a kernel ABI update. After
rebooting to install the kernel update, repeat the steps above beginning with
'cd /us/local/src' and ending with 'reboot' (inclusive of both), except omit
the 'tar ...' and moving the network cable steps.
