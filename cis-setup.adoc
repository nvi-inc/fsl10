== Introduction

These notes detail adding extra security features to Field System
Linux _10_ as advised by Center for Internet Security (CIS). With the
exception of the partition configuration, all actions are to be
performed post-installation (see the <<installation.adoc#,FSL10
      Installation>> document). All tests that failed, topics that need
to be discussed, and issues with the benchmark remediations are
provided in separate sections. A final section covers additional
steps that are needed for FS operations.

This document  is based on the results for the "`CIS Debian Linux 9
Benchmark v1.0.0 - Level 2 - Server`".

== Partition Configuration

During installation, be sure to create the logical volumes marked
optional during the partition section.

== Post-installation changes

All commands need to be run as _root_.

=== Scripted changes

As many changes as possible are implemented by the _remediate_ script.
The script is intended to be run after the "`Third Stage Installation`"
steps in the FSL10 instructions, before any further changes have been
made to the system (however initializing and adding other disks to the
RAID can intervene).

....
cd /root/fsl10
script ../remediate.txt
./remediate
exit
....

IMPORTANT: This script should not be run more than once on a system.

TIP: The use of the _script_ command causes the output to be recorded
in the specified file. This can be very helpful for understanding what
went wrong if the script fails. The script itself uses the `-x` option
to echo the commands as they are executed to make it easy to match the
output with the commands being executed.

=== Manual changes

This section covers manual operations that are required _after_ running the script.

1. Reboot and execute:
+
....
aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
....

All the CIS remediations that can applied at this point have been
completed. The next section describes some other policies that can be
considered.

=== Other policies

This section describes other policies that may be desirable. Some
are beyond the CIS benchmark.

==== /etc/hosts.deny

Add:

....
ALL:ALL
....

==== /etc/hosts.allow

Add:

....
sshd:ALL
....

It is recommended that you further restrict _sshd_ to specific hosts and/or
sub-domains.

==== Password policies

You may wish to set minimum password length to 12.

You may wish to set password reuse remember to 24.

==== Set remote log host and/or retention to a minimum of one year

You may wish to configure a remote log host and/or set log retention
period to at least one year.

To set a remote log host, edit the _/etc/rsyslog.conf_ and
_/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf_ files and add the following line (where
_loghost.example.com_ is the name of your central log host).

....
*.* @@loghost.example.com
....

Run the following command to reload the rsyslogd configuration:

....
kill -HUP rsyslogd
....

Set the retention period of system logs by editing
_/etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog_. This should be configured to store logs
for at least a minimum of a year (366 for daily 53 for weekly)..

==== Bootloader password

You may wish to create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:

....
grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>
....

Add the following into _/etc/grub.d/00_header_ or a custom
_/etc/grub.d_ configuration file:

....
cat <<EOF
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF
....

If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering
the password, edit _/etc/grub.d/10_linux_ and add `--unrestricted` to the
line `CLASS=`

IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended that booting without a password
be permitted. Otherwise, if a reboot is required to continue
operations it will not be possible unless some one with the password
is available. If they aren't available, this could lead to loss of
VLBI data and can be a safety issue.

Example:

....
CLASS="--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted"
....

Run the following commands to update the grub2 configuration and reset
the _grub.cfg_ permissions:

....
update-grub
chmod go-rwx /boot/grub/grub.cfg
....

== CIS Exceptions

This section addresses the tests that failed in the CIS benchmark
after all the remediations in this document were applied.

=== 1.4.2 Ensure bootloader password is set

Must be set later by administrators.

=== 2.2.2 Ensure X Window System is not installed

X Window system is required for FS use.

=== 2.2.4 Ensure CUPS is not enabled

CUPS is required for operations.

=== 2.2.11 Ensure IMAP and POP3 server is not enabled

Exim4 is required as MTA; it never accepts incoming remote connections
(blocked at firewall).

=== 3.5 Firewall Configuration

The firewall is configured with _ufw_ instead of _iptables_ and
_ip6tables_. This causes four to six issues depending on the details
of the installation, but _ufw_ provides the same security as the
recommended remediations. The configuration is set to by default deny
for incoming connections, enable incoming SSH connections, and sets
logging for all connections. Setup:

....
apt-get -y install ufw
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw logging on
ufw --force enable
....

=== 4.2.1.4 Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host

A remote log server must be configured by system administrators later.
	
=== 4.2.4 Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured

All files except _/var/log/wtmp_ have the requested permissions. That
file changes on a reboot to `rw-rw-r--`, owned by `root.wtmp`. No
sensitive information is stored in the file and making it readable for
others allows commands like _last_ and _who_ to work.

=== 5.2.6 Ensure SSH X11 forwarding is disabled

We require _ssh_ X11 forwarding for use with FS for remote operations
and testing.

=== 5.4.2 Ensure system accounts are non-login

System accounts (i.e., accounts with `UID` less than `1000`) _oper_
and _prog_ are needed for compatibility with the wider VLBI community
and are only used as service accounts from AUID accounts. They require
a valid shell, but direct local login and _ssh_ login (including with
    keys) are disabled for these two accounts. Note that _oper_ and
_prog_ have no password expiration (they has no passwords) or
inactivity time-out, like other system accounts.

== CIS issues that need to be addressed

This section lists further topics related to the benchmark that should be
discussed.

=== 2.2.1.2 Ensure ntp is configured

Need FS NTP configuration. That is more secure than the benchmark since
it uses `ignore` by default.

=== 2.3.4 Ensure telnet client is not installed

Would prefer to keep the _telnet_ client, it is useful for debugging
ASCII device protocol devices, which we have.  The security weakness
is _telnetd_, which is not installed, nor does the benchmark test
for it.

=== 4.1.1.2 Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full

This may not be appropriate for an operational system.

=== 5.2.13 Ensure only strong ciphers are used

What ciphers should we use?

=== 5.2.14 Ensure only strong MAC algorithms are used

What MAC algorithms should we use?

=== 5.2.15 Ensure only strong Key Exchange algorithms are used

What Key Exchange algorithms should we use?

=== 5.2.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured

Five minutes is too short.

=== 5.3.1 Ensure password creation requirements are configured

Should we use the NASA 12 character minimum?

=== 5.4.1.4 Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less

This is too short for developers/troubleshooters

== CIS Remediation problems

This section details problems with the recommended remediations.

=== 2.1.2 Ensure openbsd-inetd is not installed

Remediation solves problem, but does not make the test pass. To do the
latter required `purge`.

=== 2.2.1.2 Ensure ntp is configured

Remediation makes it less secure. A default policy of `ignore` is better.

=== 2.3.4 Ensure telnet client is not installed

The remediation does not make the test pass, that required `purge`.

=== 3.2.4 Ensure suspicious packets are logged

The remediation lines added in _/etc/sysctl.d/*_ are not respected at
boot (unlike all others). To overcome this, the following lines are
used in a new systemd service `CISfix` at boot.

....
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians=1
sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1
....

=== 4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd)

Many of the remedations are described in terms of the contents of
_/etc/audit/audit.rules_. However, the contents of that file are
auto-generated at boot from the files in _/etc/audit/rules.d_, which
is where these remediations must go.

=== 4.1.6 Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are collected

64-bit remediation had `b64` and `b32` rules concatenated on one line.

=== 4.1.17 Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected

64-bit remediation was missing `b32` rule.

== Additional set-up

After the CIS hardening is completed, some additional set-up is needed.

=== Fix-ups

There are three issues that need to be corrected after the CIS hardening.

. The AIDE package used in CIS hardening adds a line to _/etc/crontab_
to run _aide.wrapper_. Unfortunately at this time, the line inserted is
incorrectly formatted, missing the "`user`" field, for Debian systems.
This causes the _cron_ daemon to ignore the file, thereby breaking
basic _cron_ functionality. This can be fixed by adding _root_ as the
user in a new field after the fifth field on the _aide.wrapper_ line
and then running:
+
....
systemctl restart cron
....

. The CIS hardening configuration of PAM causes uses of _sudo_ that
require a password to increment the failure count when a correct
password is accepted, leading to eventual lock-out of the user using
_sudo_ when the `deny` lock-out failure count is reached.  To make sure the
`tally2` failure count is reset after a successful _sudo_ that
required a password, add to:

+
./etc/pam.d/common-account
[source,bash]
```
account required pam_tally2.so
```
+
NOTE: To reset a locked-out user after CIS hardening, use `*/sbin/pam_tally2 -u _user_ --reset*`
where `*_user_*` is the user account. Leave off the `--reset` to see what the current tally is.

. Using the `noexec` option for _/tmp_ causes a problem for the
package management system. The _dpkg-preconfigure_ program places and
executes scripts on _/tmp_ as part of package installation. The
`noexec` option prevents the execution of the scripts. To work around
this issue, you can exeucte:

    cd /root/fsl10/
    ./root_tmp

+

The _root_tmp_ script will do three things:

.. Create a one time service at boot to clean the _/root/tmp_ directory
.. Set _dpkg-preconfigure_ to use _/root/tmp_ for temporary files
.. Create an initial _/root/tmp_ directory

+

There may be other issues with using the `noexec` option for _/tmp_,
but we don't have any specifics at this time.

. Sometimes the firewall (_ufw_) does not work properly after rebooting.
This has been noticed for remote access to _gromet_ for met. data on
port 50001. There are no other known issues. An apparent fix for this
is to disable and re-enable the firewall. If you have this problem and
the same solution works, a one-time service at start-up can be created
to perform this action:

  cd /root/fsl10
  ./create_ufw_re-enable
+

The new service will run at the next reboot. It is configured to run
_after_ _ufw_ has been started.

=== Enabling user promotion to oper/prog and root

The model of FSL assumes _oper_ and _prog_ accounts will be used for
operations and programming respectively. However, some organizations may
have security and auditing restrictions that mean operators must
log-in using their own account (possibly named with their Agency User ID,
    AUID).  As the Field System currently operates, users will then
need to switch to the _oper_ or _prog_ account after login. Likewise,
     if a user is allowed to elevate to _root_, they will need to do
     so after log-in to their own account. This sub-section covers how to
     enable this capability. The next sub-section <<Adding AUID accounts>> covers how to add an
     AUID account. The method described here, and in the next sub-section,
     uses _dhorsley_ as an example user.

For _oper_ and _prog_, we suggest creating two groups that can _sudo_
to the accounts.

run _visudo_ then add at end:

    %operators      ALL=(oper) NOPASSWD: ALL
    %programmers    ALL=(prog) NOPASSWD: ALL
    %programmers    ALL=(oper) NOPASSWD: ALL

To allow _operators_ to use _refresh_secondary_, _shutdown_, and _reboot_, add (respectively):

   %operators      ALL=(ALL) /usr/local/sbin/refresh_secondary
   %operators      ALL=(ALL) /sbin/shutdown
   %operators      ALL=(ALL) /sbin/reboot

To use these commands the _operators_ will need to enter (respectively) from their AUID accounts:

   sudo refresh_secondary
   sudo shutdown
   sudo reboot

A password will be required. Trailing options can be used with the commands, as appropriate.

If the  user can elevate to _root_, also add:

    dhorsley       ALL=(root) ALL

Create the groups if they don't exist:

    addgroup operators
    addgroup programmers

If they don't already, make sure _oper_ and _prog_ have usable shells:

    chsh -s /bin/bash oper
    chsh -s /bin/bash prog

If the accounts haven't been disabled for login already, do so:

    usermod -L oper
    usermod -L prog

To prevent connecting with _ssh_ using a key, create (or add _oper_
and _prog_ to an existing) `DenyUsers` line in _/etc/ssh/sshd_config_:

NOTE: If you used the CIS _remediate_ script, you should comment out
the line: `DenyGroup rtx` as well.

....
DenyUsers oper prog
....

And restart _sshd_ with:

....
systemctl restart sshd
....

Authorized users can then switch to _oper_ with (similarly for
_prog_ and _root_):

    sudo -i -u oper

No password will be required (except for _root_).

To ensure X authorization works do the following (this example is for
user _oper_ and  works analogously for _prog_ and _root_, but see the
note at the end of step (1) about _root_'s Xresources:

1. Add this to the following file:
+
.~/.profile
[source,bash]
```
if ! [ -z "$XCOOKIE" ]; then
   xauth add $XCOOKIE
fi
if echo $DISPLAY |grep -q localhost; then
#   ssh from remote host with X display
    xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
else
    if ! [ -z $DISPLAY ]; then
      if xhost|grep -q 'SI:localuser:oper'; then
#       local X display
        xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
      fi
    else
#     text terminal, do nothing
      :
    fi
fi
```
+
This will also set the Xresources to those of _oper_. (For _root_
    only the first clause would be used since Xresources would not be
    set.)

2. Create the following file
+
./usr/local/bin/oper_account
[source,bash]
```
#!/bin/bash
set -e
if echo $DISPLAY |grep -q localhost; then
 sudo -u oper XCOOKIE="$(xauth list $DISPLAY)" -i
else
 if ! xhost|grep -q 'SI:localuser:oper'; then
   xhost +SI:localuser:oper >/dev/null
 fi
 sudo -u oper -i
fi
```

3. Execute:
+
    chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/oper_account

The three numbered steps above can be executed for _oper_, _prog_, and _root_
with:

....
~/fsl10/AUID/install_AUID
....

=== Adding AUID accounts

This sub-section describes how to add AUID accounts to be used with the
ability to promote to _oper_, _prog_, and _root_ as described in the
previous sub-section. As in the previous sub-section, the following method
uses _dhorsley_ as an example user.

. Add any needed user accounts as appropriate:

    adduser dhorsley --home /usr2/dhorsley

+
IMPORTANT: If you are configuring a spare computer, you will need to
make sure the `UID` and `GID` for each user with a home directory on
_/usr2_ is the same on both computers for the system-to-system backup
of _/usr2_ to work properly.
+

[NOTE]
====

For normal operations, AUID users' home directories should be on
_/usr2_. However, for some maintenance accounts, it may make sense to
have the home directory some where else, typically on _/home_. In that
case, use this command instead:

    adduser dhorsley

The final step of this section will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The `UID` and `GID` of the account should still be kept in agreement
between the two computers.

====

. Add each user to these groups as appropriate, e.g.:
+
NOTE: This step assumes that the _operators_ and _programmers_ groups have been created as described in the previous sub-section <<Enabling user promotion to oper/prog and root>>.
+
    adduser dhorsley operators
+
and/or:
+
    adduser dhorsley programmers

. If the user should be able to manage printers, use:

    adduser dhorsley lpadmin

. If the account will be used by an operator and/or programmer, the X11
environment needs to be set-up. The following command will move an
existing _/usr2/dhorsley_ to _/usr2/dhorsley.FSCOPY_ and create a new
_/usr2/dhorsley_ with a useful skeleton for use with the FS (you will
    be prompted for the account name):

    /usr2/fs/misc/auid_update

+
[NOTE]
====

If the user's home directory is not on _/usr2_, but is for example on
_/home_, the following commands should be used instead:

    cd /home
    mv dhorsley dhorsley.FSCOPY
    cd /usr2/fs/st.default/auid
    find . -print|cpio -pmdu /home/dhorsley
    chown -R dhorsley.dhorsley /home/dhorsley
====

=== Adjust number of login failures before lock-out

The number of login failures before lock-out can cause a problem if it
is set too low.  The main issue is for an operator working at odd
hours, alone, at a remote location, who is dealng with multiple
issue, which might include: power failures, equipment problems, and
logistical issues. It can be a chaotic situation. Typing long and
complicated passwors in the heat of battle, particularly if they vary
between machines, can be error-prone. Being locked-out will make the
situation more difficult and increase the amount of data that will be
lost.

If you find the number of login failures before lock-out too small,
you can increase it by increasing the value of the `deny` parameter
(`5` in the example below, other typical parameters are omitted and
should not be changed) in:

./etc/pam.d/common-auth
[source]
----
auth required pam_tally2.so deny=5
----

Small integer values (20 or less) should not be a signficant risk with
long and complicated passwords and a lock-out of several minutes.

=== Setting hostname alias

These steps set a more user friendly alias for the computers of the
form _fs1-<xx>_ and _fs2-<xx>_ where _<xx>_ is the station's two letter
code.  This provides a compact alias for local usage, even for sites
with more than one system, and makes the system identifiable for
remote users in a systematic way. These steps should be executed for
both the _operational_ and _spare_ computers.

. Edit _/etc/hosts_ and add the new aliases to the appropriate lines.
+
If you have two computers, add the aliases for both to the file on each computer.

. Create a file _/etc/hostname_alias_ that contains the new alias.
.. Execute
+
    cd /etc
    cp hostname hostname_alias

.. Edit the new file and change the contents to the new alias.
. Change the system's mailname
+

NOTE: To allow mail to _mailman_ mail lists to work, you may need to
make a use a fake FQDN name, perhaps by appending _.net_ to your
alias, for use in _/etc/mailname_ and
_/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf_. The two files should be
consistent.

+
.. Edit the file _/etc/mailname_ and change its contents to the new
name, without a domain name unless that is required by remote mail
hosts or mail lists. If so,
<<installation.adoc#_generate_fqdn_in_helo_for_outgoing_mail,Generate FQDN in HELO for outgoing mail>>
in the FSL10 Installation document may also be helpful.

.. Edit _/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf_, change the value of `hostnames=` to the new alias
.. Execute
+
     update-exim4.conf
     systemctl restart exim4

. For the _spare_ computer only:

.. Update _/usr/local/sbin/refresh_spare_usr2_ to use the new alias of the _operational_ computer in the _ssh_ line.

.. You will need to update the new alias for the _operational_
computer to be recognized as a known host to the _root_ account on the
_spare_ computer. You can do that by using _ssh_ to
`spare@operational` where `operational` is new alias for the
_operational_ computer. The command will give you guidance for which
lines need to be deleted in _/root/.ssh/known_hosts_. After deleting
those lines, reconnect using the same _ssh_ command and answer `*yes*`
to confirm connecting. Finally, logout of the _spare_ account on
_operational_ computer.

. Use the new alias in the user prompts and _xterm_ titles for _oper_, _prog_, and all non-system-administrator AUID accounts. In the
`.bashrc` file for each user to be changed:

.. Before the `if` block that sets `PS1` add:

    hostalias_file=/etc/hostname_alias
    if [[ -f "$hostalias_file" ]]; then
        hostalias=$(cat $hostalias_file)
    else
        hostalias=$(hostname)
    fi

.. In the two statements setting `PS1` in the `if` block, change the use of `\h` to `$hostalias`.

.. In the statement setting `PS1` in the `case` block that sets the _xterm_ window title, change the use of `\h` to `$hostalias`.

=== Installing refresh_spare_usr2 with CIS hardening

NOTE: This subsection follows the FS manual font conventions.

TIP: Read the
<<raid.adoc#_refresh_spare_usr2,refresh_spare_usr2>> section of the
<<raid.adoc#,RAID Notes for FSL10>> document for important information
on the __refresh_spare_usr2__ script.

This subsection describes the steps needed to enable use of the
_refresh_spare_usr2_ script with CIS hardening. All steps must be
performed as _root_ on the specified system. You should read all of
each step or sub-step before following it.

. On the _operational_ system:

.. Create _spare_ account. Execute:

+

----
addgroup spare --gid 2000
adduser spare --uid 2000 --gid 2000
----

+

NOTE: The user's home directory is on _/home_ (by default), not
_/usr2_.

+

+

NOTE: The UID and GID values of `2000` are chosen to make it easier to
keep the values in sync for users on both systems. In other words, it
is not necessary to worry about jumping over a low value on the
_spare_ system when values are assigned sequentially, as is the
default. If you think you might have more than 1000 users or groups,
you might want to increase the values for the _spare_ account and
group.

. On the _spare_ system.

.. Install _refresh_spare_usr2_. Execute:

  cd /usr/local/sbin
  cp -a /root/fsl10/RAID/refresh_spare_usr2 refresh_spare_usr2
  chown root.root refresh_spare_usr2
  chmod a+r,u+wx,go-wx refresh_spare_usr2

.. Customize _refresh_spare_usr2_, following the directions in the
comments in the script:

... Comment-out the lines (add leading ``#``s):

+

....
echo "This script must be customized before use.  See script for details."
exit 1
....

... Change the _operational_ in the line:

+

....
remote_node=operational
....

+

to the alias (preferred), FQDN, or IP address of your _operational_
system.

... Uncomment the line for CIS hardened systems. The commented out
form is:

+

+

....
#remote_user=spare
....

.. Create and copy a key for _root_. Execute:

+

[subs="+quotes"]
----
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id spare@_operational_
----

+

where `_operational_` is the alias, name, or IP of your _operational_
system.

+

NOTE: If _root_ already has a key, you only need the second command
above to copy it to the _spare_ account:

+

TIP: It is recommended to not set a passphrase.

.. Enable running the script with _sudo_. Use _visudo_ to add:

+

....
%operators         ALL=(ALL) /usr/local/sbin/refresh_spare_usr2
....

+

+

NOTE: It could be setup for a specific user (but not _oper_ or _prog_
in a CIS hardened system) by replacing `%operators` with the user
account name.

. On the _operational_ system:

.. Install the _rrsync_ script. Execute:

+

....
gunzip -c /usr/share/doc/rsync/scripts/rrsync.gz >/usr/local/bin/rrsync
ln -s /usr/local/bin/rrsync /usr/bin/rrsync
chmod u+x,go-x /usr/local/bin/rrsync
....

.. Set the _spare_ account to only allow a _forced command_ with _ssh_
by replacing the `ssh-rsa` at the start of the first (and only) line of
_~spare/.ssh/authorized_keys_ line with:

+

`command="sudo --preserve-env rrsync -ro /usr2" ssh-rsa`

+

+

+

TIP: If your _spare_ system is registered with DNS, you can provide
some additional security by adding ``from="__node__" `` {nbsp}(note
the trailing space) at the start of the line, where `__node__` is the
FQDN or IP address of the _spare_ system.  It may be necessary to
provide the FQDN, IP address, and/or alias of the _spare_ system in a
comma separated list in place of  `__node__` to get reliable
operation.

.. Enable the _spare_ account to run _rrsync_ with _sudo_ without a
password and passing environment variables. Use _visudo_ to add:

+

....
spare          ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:SETENV: /usr/bin/rrsync
....

.. Lock-out the _spare_ account from normal login (but it must have a
shell). This will disable password login, but not _ssh_ login with
keys, for this account. Execute:


+

----
usermod -L spare
----

.. Disable password aging and inactivity time-out for the _spare_
account. Execute:

+

+

----
chage -I -1 -M 99999 spare
----
