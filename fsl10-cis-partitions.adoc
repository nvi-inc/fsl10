These notes assume you have disks larger than 2TB so that GPT will be the
partition format selected by the installer. The also assume you are using 
BIOS (also called "legacy") boot method for your system for both
installation and the final system. If you wish to use UEFI boot, make sure
you use boot of your USB drive with UEFI  and follow the alternative steps
where given.

---

. Run usual installation, then at the partition screen. Select *Manual*.

. Select first disk, something like `SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) - 4 TB ATA SATA HARDDISK`

. Installer may warn: *You have selected an entire device to partitionâ€¦*. Select *Yes*

. Select the *FREE SPACE* under the first device

. Select *Create a new partition*

. Enter *1MB* in the size, then select *Beginning* of the disk.
** UEFI:  Enter *1GB* in the size, then select *Beginning* of the disk.

. Select *Use as* then select *Reserved BIOS boot area*
** UEFI: Select *Use as* then select *EFI System Partition (ESP)*

. Then *Done setting up the partition*.

. Next select the *FREE SPACE* and *Create a new partition* again.

. This time choose the whole amount of free space (the default).

. Select *Use as: physical volume for RAID*, then *Done setting up the partition*

. Apply the same to the second disk. 

. Select *Configure software RAID*, select *Yes* to write the changes
  to the disks.

. Select *Create MD device*, choose *RAID 1* and enter *2* as number
of devices and *0* as number of spare.

. Select the two raid partitions we just created, (these should be sda2 and sdb2)

. Select *Finish*.

. Back in partitioning, Select the space _under_ *RAID device #0*

. Select *use as* then select *Physical volume for LVM* then *Done setting up the partition*

. Now choose the 3rd option of the partition manager *Configure the Logical Volume Manager*.

. *Create volume group* enter *vg0* select the raid device *md0*.

. For each item in the following table of the following run *Create logical volume*, select *vg0* as
the volume group and assign
+
.Logical volumes
|=======================================
| Mount point    | LV label | Size

| /              | root     | 50 GB
| /boot          | boot     | 1 GB
| swap           | swap     | 4 GB
| /tmp           | tmp      | 4 GB
| /var           | var      | 8 GB
| /var/log       | log      | 4 GB
| /var/log/audit | audit    | 500 MB
| /home          | home     | 4 GB
| /usr2          | usr2     | remaining space *less 50 GB*
|=======================================

. Then for each, except *swap*, select the free space and select *Use as ext4* and select the mount point as appropriate.

. Select finish and write changes to the disks. For big disks, it may take some time to create the ext4 file systems.

. At *Install GRUB to Master Boot Record* select *yes* then select */dev/sda*
** UEFI: you will not be presented with this option

. After installation install Grub to the second device with:
+
....
grub-install /dev/sdb
....
** UEFI: Copy the boot loader partition to the second drive:
+
....
cat /dev/sda1 > /dev/sdb1
....
