To make a release:

. git checkout master
. Update version and dates in *.adoc
. git push
. git tag <tag>     (<tag>=v2, or whatever)
. git push --tags
. Follow making_gh-pages.txt to publish; through the first push is already done

Versioning

. Incremental changes accumulate on master
. For wording changes in documents, increment patch level in documents
  affected, e.g., 1.0.1, and republish gh-pages
. For changes in function, e.g., a new feature in fsadapt, increment minor
  level in affected documents (if any), e.g., 1.1, and republish
. A new release would be made if the changes should be retrofitted by existing
  users, all docs updated with the new version numbers and republished
. A major change would increment the major level, e.g., 2.0.0, and would be a
  new release with new updated documents and their version numbers, but it
  isn't clear what the use case would be, the next OS would go to a new repo,
  e.g., fsl11.
